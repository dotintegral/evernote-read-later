Evernote Read Later Chrome Extension
====================================

A chrome extension that shows evernote notes marked with 'read-later' tag.

Info
----
This is an early alpha so propably nothing will work as expeced. I'm pretty sure everything will crash when the script
will face an error or exception. Yeah, alpha stage is so much fun.


Dependencies
------------
Extension uses the following external dependencies (included in lib/ directory):

* evernote-sdk - see https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-js
* jsOAuth - see https://github.com/bytespider/jsOAuth
* underscore - because I'm lazy
* jQuery - I'm sooooo lazy....
